## Demo dashboard
The idea of this dashboard is to showcase whats possible with RShiny. 
The user interface can be customized according to the client/user specifications and this is mostly in regards to the theming and the kind of analysis that goes into the dashboard. A co-design approach with the data innovation team is encouraged for this brings about a sweet spot of the intersection between the user specification and the technical considerations that might be needful. 

Our approach to dashboard development: 

* Co-design with the client  
* Prototype presentation
* Feedback integration
* Beta version
* Deployment
* Technical side of things:
   - Ensure modulatization of the different pieces that make up the dashboard.
   - Reproducibility of the project.
   - Proper documentation of each dashboard.
   - Automation, will it be useful for the project?
   - Data access : size of the data...
   - What system should be used for deployment. 
   - Optimize the dashboard to improve performance. 
   - Data pipeline should be shipped together with the dashboard repo. 
* We're in the process of setting up a deployment system that makes it easy for other developers to host their dashboards. This should be automated in such a way that updates reflect in a matter of seconds and a few minutes for the heavy dashboards.
